 * It is the first structured thing this card reads from an attribute, and

 * SAME object, `hundredKmEC` comes as a number and `hundredMiKwhEC` comes as
 * text. Hence it being a pure function, exported and tested separately,

 *    to is exactly the defect this version came to fix. Both dates have to be
 *    calendar days the API could have meant, not merely non-empty text: see
 *    `isCalendarDay`, which is stricter than `Date` is.
 *  - **With no consumption, the entry STAYS, with the consumption as

 *    did not drive this week" — the first weeks of a freshly delivered car
 *    all come in as zero — and with the dates alongside it, the reader
 *    understands it. What cannot be written is "0.0", which would assert an

 * Same posture as `parseWeeklyConsumption` right above, and for the same
 * reason — the shape comes from a cloud API that has already been caught
 * sending a number and a string for sibling fields of one object. The rules,
 * and again the boundary between them is the point:
 *
 *  - **With no readable day, the row is DROPPED.** It cannot be labeled, and
 *    an unlabeled bar in a series of days is worse than one bar fewer.
 *  - **With a day and no distance, the row STAYS**, with the missing number
 *    as `undefined`. It is the section that writes the absence, and nothing
 *    downstream may read an absent number as a zero.
 *  - **A day already seen is DROPPED**, the first row for it winning. Two
 *    rows for one day would draw two bars carrying the same label, and there
 *    is no way to tell the reader which of them is that day — nor any way
 *    for the card to know which is right. One bar per day is the only
 *    reading of the block that is true.
 *
 * The sort is here, and not in the section, so that the first and last
 * elements are the period's real ends whoever holds the array. The API sends
 * the rows in order today; this does not depend on it continuing to.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT done: the same attributes carry a `detail_days`
 * count, and it is not compared with the number of rows that survive here.
 * A disagreement would say a row was dropped, which the card already knows
 * and has already acted on, and it names no day and no number — there is
 * nothing it could tell the reader that the reader could do anything with.
 * The block shows the days it has and claims nothing about the ones it does
 * not; because it displays no total, a missing row corrupts no figure on
 * screen. Surfacing the count would add a warning with no remedy.
 *
 * **The rows also carry an energy, and the `unit` is what lets it through.**
 * Called without one — which is the default, and which is every integration
 * up to and including v0.7.2 — the rows come out with no energy at all, so
 * nothing downstream has one to print. That default is the conservative
 * direction on purpose. The caller passes a unit only when the sensor
 * declared BOTH a scope and a unit this card can name; see
 * `buildDailyBreakdown` below.
 *
 * And the unit is checked AGAIN against each row's own `energy_unit`, which
 * v0.7.3 publishes beside the figure. A row whose unit is missing, unreadable
 * or simply different keeps its distance and loses its energy: the symbol
 * printed after a number has to be the one that arrived with that number, and
 * a sensor-level declaration is not evidence about a row that contradicts it.
 *
 * 0.4.10 removed this field: over 2026-09-04 to 2026-09-12 `daily_detail`
 * reported 21.0 kWh for 217 km while the garage charger's meter delivered
 * 53.56 kWh into a battery that ended the window where it started — and
 * nothing in the payload named the quantity. That window was eight days of a
 * period bug since fixed upstream, and the meter figure was an estimate that
 * assumed a charging loss and a usable capacity, so what it established was
 * not a factor but the absence of a label. **What changed in v0.7.2 and
 * v0.7.3 is that the integration supplies the label: a presumed scope, then a
 * unit. Both are upstream's, and the card repeats them as such.** Do not
 * upgrade either to a finding here or anywhere else; the gates below exist
 * because the last time this number went on screen with a meaning attached,
 * the meaning was wrong.
 *
 * The presumption is driving energy: traction alone, climate and accessories
 * excluded. Two aligned Monday-to-Sunday weeks, measured after the window fix,
 * are consistent with the rows being whatever `driving_energy_kwh` is:
 * 2026-09-07 to 09-13 summed to 38 kWh against 40.5 (94 %), and 2026-09-14 to
 * 09-20 to 33 against 36.7 (90 %). The 2.5 and 3.7 kWh missing are about
 * 0.4–0.5 kWh a day, which is what truncating seven values to whole
 * kilowatt-hours costs — and that truncation is the cloud's, not this card's
 * and not the integration's: the values arrive as integers and v0.7.3 marks
 * them `energy_precision: as_reported_by_cloud`. Inside the second week, days
 * of 40 km or less give 12.0 kWh/100 km and days over 40 give 12.3, so the
 * trip-length effect an earlier version of this comment described does not
 * appear in an aligned week.
 *
 * **None of which says what the rows count.** Both weeks compare the rows
 * against another attribute of the SAME integration fed by the same cloud
 * field (`energy_source: accumulatedEnergyConsume`), so they show internal
 * consistency and not external truth; the climate share was 16.4 % and 16.8 %,
 * essentially unchanged, so neither week moves the variable that would
 * separate a driving-only reading from a total one; and it is one car, one
 * driver, two weeks. Upstream says the same in its own way:
 * `energy_scope_confirmed` is false because its author cannot confirm the
 * reading from his own captures either. See
 * https://github.com/kerniger/leapmotor-ha/issues/67.
 *
 * The figure is read from `driving_energy_kwh` and falls back to the older
 * `energy_kwh`, which v0.7.2 and v0.7.3 keep beside it carrying the same
 * numbers for compatibility. Only a MISSING key falls back, not an unreadable
 * one: a `driving_energy_kwh` of `''` is that row failing to report, and the
 * stale twin of a field that failed is not a better answer than the absence.
 * Otherwise the energy follows the same rules as the distance — negative or
 * unreadable is an absence, a zero is a zero.
 *
 * That line is drawn by `??`, so a `null` counts as missing and falls back
 * where `''` does not — and a Python integration writes `None` for a field it
 * could not compute, which is arguably the same failure `''` reports. The
 * asymmetry was noticed and kept: a key present as `null` reads as "this
 * integration does not populate this name", which is the case the fallback is
 * for, where `''` reads as "this name is mine and today it has no value". It
 * decides nothing today, because both names carry identical numbers; the day
 * they can disagree, this is the paragraph to revisit.
 *
 * **`energy_raw` is never read.** v0.7.3 puts the cloud's bare number there
 * on the cars whose unit it could not verify, and a bare number whose unit is
 * disputed is the exact thing this whole gate refuses to print.

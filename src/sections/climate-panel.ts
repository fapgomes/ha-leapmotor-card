  /**
   * Where there's a control there's no drawing: neither the steering wheel
   * nor the mirrors are drawn (see `cabin-topview.ts`). The chip IS the
   * part, and that's why its position isn't "over the part it commands" but
   * "in the place of the part it commands", in the drawing's coordinates
   * (viewBox 200 x 240 — the `left` values resolve against 200, the `top`
   * values against 240):
   *   - mirrors: TWO chips, one at each front corner, 7.5% and 92.5% / 9.5%
   *     (centers at 15; 22.8 and 185; 22.8). This is where the ears of an
   *     exterior rearview mirror are — outside the cabin, ahead of the doors
   *     — and it's where the app places its own two chips, flush against the
   *     margins. They sit ABOVE the fascia's line, without touching it: the
   *     highest point of the line under a chip is y = 39.6 (at the inner
   *     edge, x = 27.5 and x = 172.5) and the chip ends at y = 35.3, so 4.3
   *     units of clearance. That leaves 2.5 units (4 px) for the box's
   *     margin, which is the "more to the side" that was asked for;
   *   - steering wheel: ahead of the driver's seat, 28.5% / 22.29% (center
   *     at 57; 53.5 — the same x as the driver's pill, so plumb with it).
   *     This chip no longer has the fascia's line passing behind it: the
   *     lowest point of the line across the chip's width is at y = 35.05
   *     (left edge, x = 44.5) and the chip starts at y = 41.0, i.e. 5.9
   *     units below it; and it ends at y = 66.0, 6.0 from the driver's
   *     headrest (y = 72). It sits between the two, flush against the
   *     driver and not the fascia, which is where a steering wheel belongs.
   *     It was to fit here that the drawing's box grew from 228 to 240;
   *   - pills: over the backrest of each seat, 28.5% and 71.5% / 47.5%
   *     (centers 57 and 143 in x, 114 in y; backrest from y = 90 to y = 138).
   *     These stay over the drawing because the backrest is BIGGER than the
   *     pill and isn't the same shape: the seat is visible around it, and it
   *     reads as a seat with a control on top of it. That's what the 38 x 28
   *     wheel under a 25 chip couldn't do — two round shapes of almost the
   *     same size, one on top of the other, read as a smudge.
   *
   * TWO CHIPS, ONE SWITCH. The integration exposes a single
   * `switch/rearview_mirror_heat` for the mirror pair — the two always heat
   * together, there's no way to heat just one. The two chips in this view
   * say exactly that: they both read the SAME `c.mirrorHeat` (so they light
   * up and turn off together, and one's `aria-pressed` is always the
   * other's) and both fire the SAME `mirrorHeat`, which is a single service
   * request no matter which side it comes from. There's no per-chip state
   * here, nor half an entity: what would be a lie is two chips that look
   * like they command one mirror each.
   *
   * What the drawing can't say, the accessible names say: each chip
   * announces itself as "Mirrors · both · left/right button". The "both"
   * comes first and is what matters — whoever reaches the left chip by
   * keyboard learns they're commanding the pair; the "left button" part
   * only serves to distinguish one chip from the other, and it talks about
   * the BUTTON, never the mirror.
   *
   * The mirrors' icon is `mdi:mirror`: an oval with two highlights, which is
   * the glass of a rearview mirror. The `mdi:mirror-rectangle` that used to
   * be here is a rectangle with another rectangle inside and read as a
   * mobile phone or a door. The app uses a heated-glass icon, and the MDI
   * equivalent would be `mdi:car-defrost-rear` — but that one is, stroke for
   * stroke, the `mdi:car-defrost-front` of the Defrost button further down
   * in this SAME panel (a windshield with three heat waves), just with
   * rectangular glass instead of trapezoidal. At 18px they're the same
   * icon. The heat is conveyed by the label and by the panel this lives in;
   * the shape says "mirror".

     *
     * Clearances to the box's margins (everything inside, in units / px):

     *   - bottom: 240 - 127.75 = 112.25 / 179.6 (the pills).
     *
     * Clearances to the drawing, which is what the two top chips gained:
     *   - mirrors -> fascia line: the line is highest at the inner edge of
     *     each chip (x = 27.5 and x = 172.5), at y = 39.6; the chip ends at
     *     y = 35.3, so 4.3 units (6.9px).
     *   - mirrors -> top of the door panels (y = 46): 10.7 (17.1px).

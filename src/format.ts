 * range: with `'2-digit'` the per-day breakdown wrote `Sep 4 – 11` in its
 * heading and `Sep 04` in the rows beneath it, which is one block spelling
 * the same day two ways. Between padding a range `Intl` will not pad and

 * instead of writing an `Invalid Date`.
 *
 * It is a range of DAYS and not of weeks, despite having been written for
 * the weekly series: the per-day breakdown uses it for a period the API
 * decides the length of, which was eight days on the car this was built
 * against. Nothing here counts the days, and nothing here should.
 *
 * Two choices that are not obvious:
 *
 *  - **`formatRange`, and not two dates glued together.** It is the one that
 *    knows how to collapse the repeated month — joining `Intl.format()` from
 *    each end gave `Aug 24 – Aug 30` in English and an extra month in
 *    Portuguese. The fields are the same as `formatDayLabel` right above,
 *    day and short month, so the card does not invent a date scale here that
 *    it does not use anywhere else.
 *  - **`timeZone: 'UTC'`.** The API sends calendar days (`2026-08-24`), which
 *    `Date` reads as midnight UTC. Formatted in the reader's timezone, in a
 *    timezone west of Greenwich they would all move to the previous day —
 *    the week of 24–30 would show up to someone as 23–29.
